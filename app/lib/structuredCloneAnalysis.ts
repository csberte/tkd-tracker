// Analysis of structuredClone usage in the codebase

/*
FIXED: All structuredClone references have been replaced with React Native compatible fallback

1. WHERE WAS STRUCTUREDCLONE STILL BEING USED?

After searching through all files, structuredClone was found in:
- app/lib/utils.ts: deepClone function (NOW FIXED)
- app/lib/clonePolyfill.ts: safeClone function (NOW FIXED)
- components/AuthProvider.tsx: Updated logging (NOW FIXED)
- app/lib/supabaseHelpers.ts: Updated logging (NOW FIXED)

All instances have been replaced with JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) fallback for React Native compatibility.

2. IS DEEPCLONE() COMPATIBLE NOW?

Yes, confirmed that deepClone() now uses React Native compatible implementation:
- app/lib/utils.ts: Uses JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) with error handling
- components/AuthProvider.tsx: Updated to log 'React Native compatible fallback'
- app/lib/supabaseHelpers.ts: Updated to log 'React Native compatible fallback'

3. METRO CACHE CLEARING

To ensure the fix takes effect:
1. Stop current Expo Go preview completely
2. Run 'npx expo start -c' to clear Metro cache
3. Wait 90-120 seconds before generating new QR code
4. Check logs for 'React Native compatible fallback' messages

CONCLUSION:
All structuredClone usage has been replaced with React Native compatible JSON-based cloning.
The app should now work in Expo Go without structuredClone errors.
